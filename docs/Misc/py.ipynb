    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages in the world. Known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive ecosystem, Python is widely used in software engineering, data science, web development, machine learning, and automation.  \n",
    "It serves as both an excellent beginner’s language and a powerful tool for professionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What Is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**.  \n",
    "It was designed with the philosophy of **code readability** and **clear syntax**, often described as “executable pseudocode.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s design emphasizes:\n",
    "- Simplicity and minimalism\n",
    "- Expressive syntax\n",
    "- Support for multiple paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming)\n",
    "- Large standard library\n",
    "- Portability across operating systems\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Is Python So Popular?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s popularity comes from several practical advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Description |\n",
    "|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Readable Syntax** | Python code reads like plain English, making it ideal for beginners. |\n",
    "| **Cross-Platform** | Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems like Raspberry Pi. |\n",
    "| **Huge Ecosystem** | Thousands of open-source libraries for every domain. |\n",
    "| **Community Support** | A vibrant global community contributes tutorials, tools, and extensions. |\n",
    "| **Integration** | Works easily with C/C++, Java, databases, and web APIs. |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interpreted**  \n",
    "   No need for compilation — Python executes code line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Typing**  \n",
    "   You don’t have to declare variable types explicitly.  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   x = 42\n",
    "   x = \"Hello\"  # same variable name, different type\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indentation-Based Syntax**  \n",
    "    Code blocks are defined by indentation, not curly braces.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    if x > 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Positive\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Non-positive\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Object-Oriented**  \n",
    "    Everything in Python is an object — even functions and modules.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. **Extensive Standard Library**  \n",
    "    Python comes with modules for file I/O, math, networking, web servers, regular expressions, and more.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. The Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is **interpreted**, meaning you can run code directly from a terminal or script file.  \n",
    "There are several ways to execute Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interactive mode**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    >>> print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "    Hello, World!\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Script mode**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python3 myscript.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Notebook environment**  \n",
    "    (e.g., Jupyter Notebook for data science)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "You can also embed Python inside C/C++ programs or call C code from Python for performance-critical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Python Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has two major branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python 2.x** — legacy (no longer supported since 2020)\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Python 3.x** — the current and recommended version\n",
    "    \n",
